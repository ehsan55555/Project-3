# NYC Collision Data Interactive Map Proposal

## Overview
This project aims to create an interactive map to visualize and analyze New York City collision data. We will use the Chart.js library to present key insights to users. The project will offer different views for a comprehensive exploration of the data.

## Goals
We will focus on three goals:

- **Number of Collisions per Borough (Bar Chart):**
  - Create a bar chart using Chart.js to display the number of collisions per borough.
  - Each bar represents a borough, and the height of the bar represents the collision count.

- **Borough-Specific Fatality Rate (Pie Chart or Donut Chart):**
  - Calculate the fatality rate for each borough (fatality count divided by total collision count).
  - Use a pie chart or donut chart to visualize the borough-specific fatality rates.
  - Each segment of the chart represents a borough, and the size of the segment corresponds to the fatality rate.

- **Count of Drivers Distracted by Texting per Borough (Bar Chart or Pie Chart):**
  - Create a bar chart or pie chart to show the count of drivers distracted by texting per borough.
  - Each bar or segment represents a borough, and the size/height represents the count of distracted drivers.

## Interactive Map Features
- Multiple views available for comprehensive data exploration.
